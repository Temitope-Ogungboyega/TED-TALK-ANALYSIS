# TED-TALK-ANALYSIS
## Overview
This text analysis project involved an in-depth examination of four influential TED talks by renowned speakers Jane Goodall and Dan Ariely. The project aimed to uncover key differences and similarities in speaking style, rhetoric, sentiment, and themes related to human behavior and decision-making.
